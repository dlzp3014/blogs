AutoCloseable接口的实现为一个持有资源需要关闭的对象，如`file or socket handles`。当退出`try-with-resources`声明在资源规范头中的块时AutoCloseable#close()方法被自动调用，这种结构准时地确保资源释放，避免资源耗尽`exhaustion`异常和可能出现的错误。可以使用此代码片段代替`try{}catch(Exception e)finally{}`结构。示例如下:





```java
public class BaseAutoClose implements AutoCloseable {
    @Override
    public void close() throws Exception {
        System.out.println("auto close resource...");
    }

    public void execute() {
        System.out.println("execute...");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (BaseAutoClose baseAutoClose = new BaseAutoClose()) {

            baseAutoClose.execute();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
console:
execute...
auto close resource...

try (BaseAutoClose baseAutoClose = new BaseAutoClose()) {

    baseAutoClose.execute();
} catch (Exception e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}


execute...
java.lang.Exception: execute exception...
auto close resource...
	at tech.dlzp.java.code.utils.BaseAutoClose.execute(BaseAutoClose.java:11)
	at tech.dlzp.java.code.utils.BaseAutoClose.main(BaseAutoClose.java:17)

```


AutoCloseable接口描述如下:

```java
/**
 * An object that may hold resources (such as file or socket handles)
 * until it is closed. The {@link #close()} method of an {@code AutoCloseable}
 * object is called automatically when exiting a {@code try-with-resource块退出
 * try}-with-resources block for which the object has been declared in 在资源规范头声明
 * the resource specification header. This construction ensures prompt  [/prɒmpt/]及时、准确 
 * release, avoiding resource exhaustion exceptions and errors that
 * may otherwise occur.
 *
 * @apiNote
 * <p>It is possible, and in fact common 实际上是普遍, for a base class to 对于实现AutoCloseable接口的基类即使不是所有的子类
 * implement AutoCloseable even though not all of its subclasses or 或者实例持有释放的资源的可能
 * instances will hold releasable resources.  For code that must operate
 * in complete generality, or when it is known that the {@code AutoCloseable}
 * instance requires resource release, it is recommended to use {@code
 * try}-with-resources constructions. However, when using facilities such as
 * {@link java.util.stream.Stream} that support both I/O-based and
 * non-I/O-based forms, {@code try}-with-resources blocks are in
 * general unnecessary when using non-I/O-based forms.

public interface AutoCloseable {
    /**
     * Closes this resource, relinquishing any underlying resources. 关闭此资源，释放任何底层资源
     * This method is invoked automatically on objects managed by the
     * {@code try}-with-resources statement. try-with-resources语句
     *
     * <p>While this interface method is declared to throw {@code 声明抛出Exception异常
     * Exception}, implementers are <em>strongly</em> encouraged to 鼓励接口实现者声明具体的指定异常
     * declare concrete implementations of the {@code close} method to
     * throw more specific exceptions, or to throw no exception at all
     * if the close operation cannot fail. 如果关闭操作不失败不抛出异常
     *
     * <p> Cases where the close operation may fail require careful 关闭操作可能失败，需要实现者注意
     * attention by implementers. It is strongly advised to relinquish 释放
     * the underlying resources and to internally <em>mark</em> the 在抛出异常之前，内部标记资源关闭，
     * resource as closed, prior to throwing the exception. The {@code
     * close} method is unlikely to be invoked more than once and so 不太可能被多次调用
     * this ensures that the resources are released in a timely manner. 及时地释放资源
     * Furthermore 此外it reduces problems that could arise when the resource
     * wraps, or is wrapped, by another resource. 
     *
     * <p><em>Implementers of this interface are also strongly advised
     * to not have the {@code close} method throw {@link

     *此异常与线程的中断状态交互
     * This exception interacts with a thread's interrupted status,
     * and runtime misbehavior 不良行为 is likely to occur if an {@code
     * InterruptedException} is {@linkplain Throwable#addSuppressed
     * suppressed}. 
     *
     * More generally, if it would cause problems for an
     * exception to be suppressed 抑制, the {@code AutoCloseable.close}
     * method should not throw it.
     *
     * <p>Note that unlike the {@link java.io.Closeable#close close}
     * method of {@link java.io.Closeable}, this {@code close} method
     * is <em>not</em> required to be idempotent 幂等性.  In other words, 当前方法不需要幂等性

     * visible side effect 明显的副作用, unlike {@code Closeable.close} which is
     * required to have no effect if called more than once.
     *
     * However, implementers of this interface are strongly encouraged
     * to make their {@code close} methods idempotent.

     * @throws Exception if this resource cannot be closed
